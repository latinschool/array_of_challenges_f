#There are two boxes of delicious donuts sitting in front of you. They're everyrthing you dreamed of and more. 
#But there's a problem. We don't know who the donuts belong to!


#Create a hash where donuts are assigned to specific classmates


#Puts the donut of a specific person

#Add another donut classmate pair into your hash

#Find a method that lets you see all the donuts of your hash


#Find three hash methods and experiment with them here:



#BONUS: Iterate through the hash and print a sentence for each student/donut pair. Example: "James calls dibs on a chocolate cake donut!"
